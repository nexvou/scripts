## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Template Method Pattern**: Used in BaseScraper for consistent scraping flow
- **Singleton Pattern**: BrowserManager ensures single browser instance
- **Factory Pattern**: Scraper instantiation through factory methods
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven logging and monitoring

### Performance Considerations
- Memory usage optimized for long-running processes
- CPU usage balanced with scraping effectiveness
- Network requests minimized through intelligent caching
- Database connections pooled for efficiency

### Security Measures
- No sensitive data in logs
- Environment variable validation
- Input sanitization for all extracted data
- Rate limiting to respect website policies

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for database operations
- End-to-end tests for complete scraping flows
- Performance tests for memory and CPU usage
